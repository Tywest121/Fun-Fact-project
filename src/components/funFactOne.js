            <ul>
                <li>The origins of football can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where various forms of ball games were played. The earliest recorded instances date as far back as 2500 BCE in ancient Egypt, where a game known as “Harpaston” involved teams competing to control a ball.</li>
                <li>However, the modern game of football has its roots in medieval village ball games in 19th century England, which was gradually moulded and developed in the elite boys public schools of Victorian England such as Winchester School.</li>
                <li>The sport we in the United States know and love as football is more properly called gridiron football, for the vertical yard lines that mark the field. Closely related to two ancient English sports—rugby and soccer (or association football)—gridiron football originated at universities in North America, primarily the United States, in the late 19th century.</li>
                <li>The man most responsible for the transition from this rugby-like game to the sport of football we know today was Walter Camp, known as the “Father of American Football.” </li>
